Don't be afraid of asking for help.
Students around you were as lost as you when they started.
You'll meet people from a lot of different backgrounds.
It's a really important aspect of the school.

This section is slim because teaching manners is not the purpose of this guide but a small idea of what to do :
- be kind
- be respectful
- be on time when needed
- learn to laugh but also be serious
- accept differences, we all had a life before school, you are no one to judge
- a wrong answer is a future improvement and not a personal attack
- be wrong, you can't be always right, you'll learn way more by doing mistakes
- **be you**, the most important thing of all
