# Peer to Peer

A lot have already been said. But we will expand on this.

You are supposed to fail alone but succeed as a team.

Projects are personal, but the 42 experience is a group focused curriculum.

Even if you are an introvert, you should try to have one or two friends around you. They will have connections and their connections will have even more.

Create discords, groups, meet outside of school, live like a student not a lonely worker. Loneliness is deadly, humans are social creatures. 

Keep in mind that a lot of us, including me, come to school because of the people we met during the Piscine.

Don't be rude with others, they might give you the solution to your project between jokes and brainstorming.

Enjoy your time! You are to learn not to prove you are better. The only thing you are allowed to compare is ``how you started VS how far you are now``.

Good luck to you all!
