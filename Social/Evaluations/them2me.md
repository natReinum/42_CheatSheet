# How to get evaluated?

### **You need to have at least a point to reserve a correction from your project page**

The project evaluation is not a personal attack on your work. It should be named "Project Defense."

You will defend your choices and explain your logic. If you coded your project by yourself, then you will know how to answer every question asked. If the question does not concern the project, you are allowed to dismiss it

### What to do before :
- be on time
- read your code again to have is fresh in your mind, you are allowed to check your own code, but it's quicker is your know where to search
- good luck, it's an exchange, don't freak out, the other one could be as lost as you when you started

### What to do during the evaluation :
- answering questions from your corrector
- showing how your code works
- don't stress
- be clear about your logic
- try to explain the subject even if the other student did not do it

### What to do after :
- give feedback on the evaluation, be respectful but be real
- correct the mistakes is they were any or at least note them
- go to the next one or enjoy your final grade! You can retry if the grade is not enough for you (max 125)

### Manners during evaluations :
- be kind and respectful of your corrector, even if it's not mutual, if you are you will be also punished
- accept your mistakes, you are perfect, this does not impact how great of a human you are
- you can show your own tests to display how far you imagined your program, you will maybe gain a star!
- know your code, you are supposed to know how everything works

### ❌ Forbidden in evaluations ❌
- any violence will get you expelled
- you have no rights to bully or put the other student in an uncomfortable place
- negotiating your grade
- change the code
- use a tester and ask for the grade immediately, a tester does not prove anything because you can access its code
