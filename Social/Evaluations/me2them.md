# How to evaluate someone?

### **You need to set your correction slot in the [Intra](https://profile.intra.42.fr/slots) to be able to have an evaluation!**

When you have a correction locked in, you will be notified by email and a line will appear on the ``Evaluations`` part of your profile.

You will be able to see the time of the evaluation and the subject you will correct.

The Intra of the student you will correct appears 15 minutes before the evaluation starts.

### What to do before :
- be on time
- get prepared, you don't need to finish the given project to correct it. At least read the mandatory part so you will start to think about questions to ask
- you will need to walk to the student PC, so check where to find him on his intra
- don't stress, even if the project is wrong, you are just doing what you are supposed to do

### What to do during the evaluation :
- connect yourself on your Intra profile to start (``Evaluations`` tab, a link will be present to correct the current project), use a private tab on the browser to avoid logging out the student
- git clone from the link given at the start of the evaluation (``git clone link dir_name``)
- the subject PDF file will be at the start of the link you opened
- read the correction page one line after the other, it will guide you threw the correction, feel free to ask personal questions, you need to understand the logic behind the student mind
- if the Norminette gives one error, go to the bottom of the page and click on the corresponding flag, the evaluation ends here
- if there is one leak, same, different flag but the same result
- ⚠️ remember to write feedback of the project if you don't all checkboxes you checked before will reset, and you will have to go threw the entire page again

### Manners during evaluations :
- be kind, curious and comprehensive of the student's work
- use Norminette and Valgrind
- cheating is forbidden, if you suspect someone of not knowing their code enough or find someone else's name or commentaries in the code, feel free to flag a cheat
- you can try twisted input, create a main function to test the project to its fullest
- in no circumstances the project should leak or SEGFAULT, you have a specific flag for this behavior, straight 0
- be serious, you are allowed to tchat, but your correction has to be rigorous

### ❌ Forbidden in evaluations ❌
- any violence will get you expelled
- you have no rights to bully or put the other student in an uncomfortable place; your questions should only concern the subject
- you **HAVE** to correct the version you got from the ``git clone`` any other local version has to be ignored
- negotiating the grade
- correcting someone on his own personal computer
- change the code, you can create a main and compile, but you are not allowed to change any file content or name in the project
- if the project has already a main, you are not allowed to compile another main to force an error
- the use of testers to have a faster correction is strictly forbidden. If you happen to use one you are not allowed to decide if the project is correct or not, do this using your own tests
