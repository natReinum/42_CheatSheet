# Points Management

You start your journey as a Stud with 3 points and with 5 points during the Piscine.

Projects take three corrections to be eligible to be validated.

Evaluations cost you 1 point. You will give this point to the one correcting you. Longer project can give you more points.

During the Piscine the Moulinette is the final corrector, so you only have two corrections (you only spend 2 points);

Know that asking for an appointment will lock your point, even if you cancel, so **be sure to be available at that time.**

If you need to correct someone and you cancel the evaluation, one of your points will be given to the one you should have corrected.

Don't wait for more points, they will be reset if you have too many of them at the end of the week. Don't wait to get evaluated either. Failing early gives you more time to retry.
