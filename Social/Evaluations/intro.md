# Evaluations

The essence of the 42 School, you don't have teachers, but you need to be corrected by someone.

Evaluations cost you 1 point, you start with some points like everyone. You will give this point to the one correcting you. Longer project can give you more points. 

Projects take three corrections to be eligible to be corrected by the Moulinette or validated.

Know that asking for an appointment will lock your point, even if you cancel, so **be sure to be available at that time.**

Don't wait for more points, they will be reset if you have too many of them at the end of the week. Don't wait to get evaluated either. Failing early gives you more time to retry.

You will still be evaluated by four 'types' of people :
- **Studs**, during your Piscine you will encounter 'rushes,' they will be corrected by one Tutor from the school
- **People around you**, this is the most common way of getting evaluated, people who are more advanced and less advanced can correct you
- **Moulinette**, the Moulinette is not a definitive answer to your project. It's a strict evaluator that you will never see but at the same time you don't have to defend your decisions regarding your project, it will be a straight 'yes' or 'no'
- **The Bocal**, in extreme cases the Bocal will come and correct you, if it happens, you likely did something wrong, so don't cheat and don't copy others' work, if you do then assume consequences

Now that you know who will correct you, let's see how to approach evaluations :
