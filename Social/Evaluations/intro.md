# Evaluations

The essence of the 42 School, you don't have teachers, but you need to be corrected by someone.

You will still be evaluated by four 'types' of people :
- **Studs**, during your Piscine you will encounter 'rushes,' they will be corrected by one Tutor from the school
- **People around you**, this is the most common way of getting evaluated, people who are more advanced and less advanced can correct you
- **Moulinette**, the Moulinette is not a definitive answer to your project. It's a strict evaluator that you will never see but at the same time you don't have to defend your decisions regarding your project, it will be a straight 'yes' or 'no'
- **The Bocal**, in extreme cases the Bocal will come and correct you, if it happens, you likely did something wrong, so don't cheat and don't copy others' work, if you do then assume consequences

Now that you know who will correct you, let's see how to approach evaluations :
