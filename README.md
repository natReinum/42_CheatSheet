## Disclaimer

A cheatsheet is a quick reference guide, not the answer to your project nor life-threatening problems.

This project is a tool. You can choose not to use it, but if you copy a finished project, you may get banned. The choice is yours.

We will talk here about projects, tools, IDEs,
notions, shortcuts and others small things.

We are a group of students that want to help, never forget to socialize;
the Piscine is made for this, the bigger the group,
the more skills will be united.
(Not necessary coding ones, it does not matter you are here to learn not to know.)

You are more than a line, a number, or a grade.
Never underestimate your inner strength and remember your humanity.
With these principles, not matter what you do, you will succeed.

### For 42 Staff
We will not give answers to projects, just hints to look for.
We want to boost confidence and help people to get better at what they do.
If any of the content here is breaking the TOS of 42 school feel free to email/discord me,
