# Planing

**We will consider you already are subscribed to a Piscine. We will not talk about how to create an account and register.**

A Piscine is the exam to be able to enter the 42 School.
It starts on a monday and ends on a friday for a total time of 26 days.

They are three important things to consider :
- ``Module``, you need to complete as many of them as possible in this timespan, don't stress, do what you can do, you are here to learn
- ``Exam``, there are four of them, always on friday from 16–20h for the first 3 then the last one is the final exam and lasts 8h
- ``Rush``, there are three rushes, a rush starts on friday night (usually after the exam), and it ends at 23:42 on sunday

You will learn more about them in the following parts; this section is to talk about planning.

If we consider that you chose to do the three rushes (don't skip exams,
well you can, but it's up to you if you want to be accepted).
