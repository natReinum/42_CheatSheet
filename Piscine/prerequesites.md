# Prerequisite

None.
Sleep, drink water and have a good calorie intake (eat), and you are good to go.

Having a fixed sleep schedule helps
(not necessary a classic one, 9–17h is as good as 20–8h if you are efficient in both cases).

Be aware, having an offset sleep schedule can be detrimental to attend properly to the exams.

You will need to create a [Discord](https://discord.com/) for the online part of the school.
 
Having a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account is handy, you are advised to have one during your time at the school.
