# The Piscine

This part is to give you confidence not answers. 

We will sever this part quite a lot :
- [Prerequisites](./prerequesites.md)
- [Planing](./planing.md)
- [Modules](./modules.md)
- [Exams](./exams.md)
- [Rushes](./rush.md)

Some tips for your Piscine, we know it can be stressful but don't worry; it's a wonderful experience.
- if you are looking for the subjects, **don't**.This is not the goal; you don't attend Med School if you already are a surgeon in a clinic
- if you want to be prepared like never before than before, read the Prerequisites part
- you are expected to know nothing about code, terminal, memory and even computers (well, we hope you know how to use a keyboard and a mouse)
- failing is normal, common, an everyday thing, don't get overwhelmed it's supposed to happen, you will learn by failing like humans do since the beginning of civilization
- you can do two Piscine in your life, if you fail one you can still try again!
