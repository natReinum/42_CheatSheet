# ..: cd, change directory :..

The default explorer will, one day, never be opened again.
This command is used to navigate between directories and directories **only**.
The syntax is :

```bash
$ cd directory/subdirectory
$ pwd
/home/your_user/directory/subdirectory
```

For those who like visuals :

![cd and wildcard exemple](../../Ressources/cd.PNG)

(Here the wildcard ``~`` redirected me to the ``/root`` folder because I'm connected as the root user, it is the only one that behave like this)

You should check the options as always with the command ``man``.
