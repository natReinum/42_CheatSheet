# Tools

If you are in a Piscine, welcome to 42!
I advise you to carefully read this part.

The 42 logic is that you have to look for information. 
So don't be afraid of using Google or any search engine.

So let's jump in some quick overview of each subject.

## [Terminal](Terminal/intro.md)

First you will be afraid of it, then you will fall in love.

The terminal is all you need to work, you could in theory never use anything else.
But because we are humans, and we like pretty things, we made [GUIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface).
Despite all of that, you can finish your curriculum only with this tool and the help of your friends and your browser.

Here you will find a list of useful commands. It's basic, and it's the purpose of this guide.

## [VIM](./Vim/intro.md)

Small disclaimer before we start: we won't talk about Neovim because it's Vim with improvements.

Vim is a terminal text editor.
It is very customizable and has a lot of tricks.
This guide will not be an exhaustive list of all the wonderful options Vim has.

## [Norminette](./Norminette/intro.md)

This will be quick, you **NEED** to read this if you don't know what it is.

*If you are currently doing the Piscine and doing the Shell exercises, come back later.*

## [Valgrind](./Valgrind/intro.md)

Like the Norminette above, you need to go throw this if you want to validate a project.

*If you don't know what the ``void *malloc(size_t size)`` function does, don't bother reading this.*

## [LLDB](./LLDB/intro.md)

This tool is a bit hard to learn, it allows you to debug your project.

You can totally live without it, but it's easier with it. 

You have another debugger known as ``GDB``. The creator of this repo does not use it, so if you want to learn it, use Google!

*If you are currently doing the Piscine, I would recommend trying to understand your mistakes first, ask a neighbor or a friend before using a debugger.*

## [AI](./AI/intro.md)

We will talk about it but the quick version of this is : **Don't use it if you don't know how to use it**
