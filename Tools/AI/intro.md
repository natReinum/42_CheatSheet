# AI

Using AI can be dangerous, be warned.
AI's generated code is a straight answer, you don't learn anything from that.

Copy-pasting code from stackoverflow is as bad as AI's code.
You can, of course, look at it, you need to start somewhere, but don't mindlessly copy and use it.
It will, in 99% of cases, fail you at the end.

You can learn using AI **as a last resort**. Prefer talking to your friends and neighbors. Social interaction will give you way more than a text on a screen. Even if they don't know, you still can look together for solutions.

### How to set up a request to AI

**If you read this section, it's because your friends, neighbors, cousin, family and distant relatives did not have any answer to your problem.**

In your prompt, to maximize the personal improvement, you should ask for some output presentation :
- no code, or if there is code, short function to serve as an exemple
- give documentation not direct answers
- add links to official documentation of what you are looking for
- if you have trouble with text, ask for schemes

### This section is not data, but a personal opinion

ChatGPT is great for the amount of data it has. But a wonderful European AI is, according to my test, better for coding: it's [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/).

From my personal experience, it's way better for code. I find more documentation and the explanations are superior.

Feel free to try every AI but remember who you send your data to.
